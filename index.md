"*In the empty of a semi-compressed hard drive*"

**ScanDisk** is the debut release of London-based artist **Partial Defrag**. Whispered voices, car engines, and ethereal club anthems are cut up, compressed, and congealed into a fluid, late-night motif for a spectral, industrial London. Partial Defragâ€™s free-form compositions are what remains after a hard drive compression: space-optimized memory tainted with artifacts.
