"*In the empty of a semi-compressed hard drive*"

**ScanDisk** is the debut release of London-based artist **Partial Defrag**. Whispered voices, car engines, and ethereal club anthems are cut up, compressed, and congealed into a fluid, late-night motif for a spectral, industrial London. Partial Defragâ€™s free-form compositions are the leftovers of a hard drive compression: space-optimized memories tainted with artifacts.

This is an audio-visual release accompanied by a limited run of 50 CDs and three videos.

## Videos
ScanDisk is accompanied by three videos created by the artists using a mix of 3D scanning techniques and phone footage of London's suburbs. The scans were reassembled into fictional urban-industrial environments. Videos and music were created at the same time, one form affecting the other.
