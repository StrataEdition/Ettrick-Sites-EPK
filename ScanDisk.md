*“A hard drive storing the after-dark, compressed and space-optimised.”*

**ScanDisk** is the debut release of London-based artist **Partial Defrag**. Whispered voices, car engines, and ethereal club hooks are cut up, compressed, and congealed into a fluid, late-night motif for a spectral, industrial London. Partial Defrag’s free-form compositions are the leftovers of a hard drive compression: space-optimised memories tainted with artifacts.
